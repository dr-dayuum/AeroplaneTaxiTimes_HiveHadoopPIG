# Description for GitBook Projects

In this project I had to calculate the average, maximum, and minimum taxi duration of each airline from 2000 to April 2008 (bar 2001 because the dataset was corrupted.) The dataset was obtained from https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/dataexpo/dataexpo2009. Since the dataset has more than a million records, it is better to use Hadoop, Apache Pig, and Hive for this example. To be able to use Hadoop, we first need to include a mapper and a reducer.
